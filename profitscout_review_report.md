# ProfitScout Engine: Strategy and AI Review

**Date:** January 4, 2026
**Author:** Manus AI

## 1. Introduction

This report provides a comprehensive review of the `profitscout-engine` repository, with a specific focus on the logic within the **enrichment** and **serving** pipelines. The analysis addresses two primary questions posed by the user:

1.  An evaluation of the options trading strategy against best practices for directional premium buying, using `gammarips.com` as a philosophical benchmark.
2.  An assessment of the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) for stock analysis, identifying potential blind spots and areas for improvement, particularly within the `news_analyzer`.

The review is based on a detailed examination of the Python source code, including the candidate selection, scoring, and serving logic, as well as external research into options trading best practices.

## 2. Options Trading Strategy Review

The engine's core strategy is to identify stocks primed for significant short-term moves and select specific options contracts to capitalize on that volatility. This aligns well with the stated goal of buying premium for profit without holding to execution.

### 2.1. Alignment with GammaRips.com Philosophy

The engine's design shows a strong philosophical alignment with the strategy of `gammarips.com`. Both systems prioritize a **stock-first approach**, identifying fundamentally and technically strong candidates before analyzing the options chain. Both focus on **buying premium** (long calls/puts) to profit from directional volatility over a short-term (swing trading) horizon.

Key similarities include:

*   **Directional Premium Buying**: The explicit goal is to profit from premium expansion, not theta decay or exercising contracts.
*   **Stock-First Analysis**: The process begins with scoring stocks based on a blend of fundamental, technical, and news-based factors.
*   **Catalyst-Driven**: There is a clear emphasis on identifying news and events that can trigger significant price movement.
*   **Aggressive Setups**: The "Rip Hunter" and "ML Sniper" tiers mirror the `gammarips.com` focus on high-gamma, explosive setups.

### 2.2. Analysis of the Multi-Tier Trading Logic

The engine employs a sophisticated, three-tier system to categorize and filter options candidates. This is a strong architectural choice, as it allows for dynamic rule application based on the conviction level of a setup.

The table below summarizes the selection criteria for each tier, based on the logic in `options_candidate_selector.py`.

| Tier                    | Conviction Source                               | DTE (Days) | Moneyness (OTM) | Min. Volume | Max. Spread | Key Characteristic                                  |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ---------- | --------------- | ----------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Tier 1: Rip Hunter**  | High LLM Score (≥0.70) or News (≥0.90)          | 10 - 60    | 0-15%           | 50          | 25%         | High fundamental or news-based conviction.        |
| **Tier 2: Swing Trader**| Moderate LLM Score (0.30 - 0.70)                | 14 - 45    | 0-15%           | 500         | 20%         | Standard, structure-driven technical setups.        |
| **Tier 3: ML Sniper**   | Top 10 Daily ML Prediction                      | 5 - 25     | Any             | >0          | 50%         | High-probability volatility prediction from ML model. |

### 2.3. Strengths of the Current Approach

The existing logic has several commendable features that form a solid foundation for a sophisticated trading system:

*   **Regime-Aware Scoring**: The `score_aggregator` dynamically adjusts the weights of news vs. technicals, correctly prioritizing news catalysts during event-driven periods. This is an intelligent design choice.
*   **Advanced Feature Engineering**: The calculation of Net Gamma Exposure (GEX) and the detection of Unusual Options Activity (UOA) are advanced techniques that provide a significant edge in identifying market-maker positioning and unusual buying pressure.
*   **Tiered Logic**: The multi-tier system allows the engine to be aggressive on high-conviction plays ("Rip Hunters," "ML Snipers") while maintaining stricter quality control for standard setups ("Swing Traders").
*   **ML Integration**: The introduction of an "ML Sniper" tier shows a forward-thinking approach to integrating predictive models directly into the selection process.

### 2.4. Weaknesses and Actionable Recommendations

While the foundation is strong, several areas deviate from best practices and introduce significant, avoidable risk. The following table details these weaknesses and provides concrete recommendations for improvement.

| Issue                               | Risk Analysis                                                                                                                                                             | Recommendation                                                                                                                                                              |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Lax Liquidity Standards**      | The **50% spread** allowance for ML Snipers is commercially unviable; it guarantees a 25% loss on a round trip. The 50-contract volume for Rip Hunters is too low, risking poor fills and inability to exit. | **Tighten all tiers.** Set a maximum allowable spread of **15%**. Increase the minimum volume for Tier 1 to at least **100-200 contracts**.                                      |
| **2. High-Risk DTE Ranges**         | The **5-25 day DTE** for ML Snipers falls into a period of extreme theta (time) decay. These are closer to lottery tickets than trades. The 10-60 day range for Rip Hunters is also too wide. | **Increase minimum DTE.** Set the minimum DTE for all tiers to **14 days**. The optimal swing trading window is **21-45 DTE**; the logic should be centered around this range. |
| **3. Buying Expensive Volatility**  | The "forgiveness logic" for Rip Hunters allows buying options with high Implied Volatility (IV). This exposes the trade to **IV crush**, where the premium collapses even if the stock moves favorably. | **Add an IV Percentile filter.** Do not forgive high IV. Reject any candidate contract where the IV Percentile is above a threshold, such as **70%**. This avoids overpaying for premium. |
| **4. Overly Optimistic `be_ok` Check** | The `_expected_move_pct` calculation uses a `haircut` of 1.0, assuming the stock will achieve 100% of its statistically expected move. This is rarely the case and overstates the probability of a trade being profitable. | **Re-introduce a conservative haircut.** Set the `haircut` parameter to **0.70-0.80**. This provides a margin of safety and ensures the breakeven point is more realistically achievable. |
| **5. Opaque ML Model Trust**        | The "ML Sniper" tier blindly trusts the ML model, bypassing all quality checks. The repository contains no information on the model's architecture, features, accuracy, or backtesting results. | **Validate and verify.** The ML model should be a feature, not a dictator. Remove the "forgiveness" logic for ML picks and instead use the ML prediction as a strong **scoring boost**. The model's performance must be tracked. |

## 3. LLM Usage and Analysis Review

The engine leverages LLMs across multiple pipelines to analyze unstructured data, a powerful and modern approach. The review focuses on the `news_analyzer` and the overall scoring methodology.

### 3.1. Evaluation of `news_analyzer`

The `news_analyzer` is tasked with identifying high-impact catalysts from news feeds. While the prompt is well-structured, there are several opportunities for improvement, particularly the "low-hanging fruit" you mentioned.

| Weakness                               | Impact                                                                                                                                      | Recommendation



                                                                                                                          - **1.  Limited Context**                      | The prompt provides only the first 400 characters of the news summary (`text`). This is insufficient for the LLM to grasp the full nuance of the story, forcing it to rely on the headline alone. | **Provide the full summary text.** Modify `_format_news_items` to pass the entire `text` field to the prompt. The LLM is capable of processing more data, and this will lead to a more informed analysis. |
| **2.  Ambiguous Browser Instruction**        | The prompt tells the LLM to use its browser tool to verify numbers but doesn't compel it. An LLM may choose to hallucinate or ignore this instruction to save a step. | **Make the instruction explicit and mandatory.** Change the prompt to: `"If a headline mentions earnings, guidance, or a contract, you MUST use your browser tool to find and cite the specific numbers (EPS, revenue, guidance range, contract value)."` |
| **3.  Lack of Recency Weighting**          | The prompt does not instruct the LLM to prioritize the most recent news. A story from three days ago is treated with the same importance as one from three hours ago. | **Add a recency instruction.** Add a line to the prompt: `"Pay closest attention to news published in the last 24-48 hours, as this is most likely to impact near-term price action."` |
| **4.  No Sentiment Aggregation**           | The model is asked for a single score for all news items. This doesn't account for conflicting reports (e.g., one bullish analyst note, one bearish news story). | **Implement a two-stage analysis.** First, ask the LLM to score each individual news item's sentiment. Second, ask for an aggregate score and analysis that synthesizes these individual scores, noting any conflicts. |

### 3.2. General LLM Usage Patterns

The prompts in `technicals_analyzer.py` and `recommendations_generator.py` are well-designed. They effectively use a "chain of thought" style by asking the model to perform specific steps (e.g., identify trend, then pattern, then score). The use of a `CURRENT SNAPSHOT` in the technicals prompt is a particularly strong technique to anchor the model in the most recent data.

However, a common weakness is the lack of explicit instructions to **quantify and cite**. Prompts should consistently demand that the LLM cite specific numbers, dates, and price levels from the source data to ground its analysis in facts and reduce the likelihood of generating vague or unhelpful text.

## 4. Conclusion and Final Recommendations

The `profitscout-engine` is a well-architected platform with a sophisticated and commercially relevant trading strategy. The core logic for identifying and scoring potential trades is sound and aligns with modern, data-driven approaches to options trading.

The most critical areas for improvement are not in its core philosophy but in its **risk management parameters and data-handling within LLM prompts.** The current liquidity and DTE standards, particularly for the ML-driven tier, expose the strategy to unnecessary and avoidable risk. Tightening these rules will significantly improve the robustness and commercial viability of the generated signals.

By implementing the recommendations outlined in this report, the `profitscout-engine` can evolve from a powerful but risky tool into a more reliable and consistently profitable decision-support system for directional options trading.

### Summary of Priority Actions:

1.  **Revise Options Selection Rules**: Immediately tighten liquidity (spread ≤ 15%) and DTE (≥ 14 days) parameters across all tiers.
2.  **Add IV Percentile Filter**: Prevent buying overpriced options by filtering out contracts with IV Percentile > 70%.
3.  **Enhance News Analyzer Prompt**: Provide full context and add mandatory, explicit instructions for browser use and recency weighting.
4.  **Re-introduce Expected Move Haircut**: Use a more realistic value (e.g., 0.75) for the `be_ok` check.
5.  **Audit the ML Model**: Begin a thorough review of the "ML Sniper" model's performance and features to move it from a black box to a transparent, validated component of the system.
