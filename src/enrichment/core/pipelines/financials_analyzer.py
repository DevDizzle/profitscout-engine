    prompt = r"""You are a sharp financial analyst evaluating quarterly financial data to assess a company's health and trajectory over the next 6-12 months.

Use **only** the JSON provided. Your analysis **must** be grounded in the data.

### Key Interpretation Guidelines
1.  **Growth**: Is revenue growing? Cite the revenue figures from the first and last quarters provided.
2.  **Profitability**: Are margins expanding or contracting? Reference the `grossProfitRatio`.
3.  **Cash Flow**: Is the company generating or burning cash? Cite the `operatingCashFlow` from the most recent quarter.
4.  **Solvency**: How is the company's debt changing? Cite the `totalDebt` from the first and last quarters.
5.  **Synthesis**: Combine these points into a cohesive narrative.

### Example Output (for format and tone; do not copy values)
{{example_output}}

### Step-by-Step Reasoning
1.  Compute and compare quarterly changes for key metrics (Revenue, Gross Margin, Operating Cash Flow, Total Debt).
2.  Classify each as bullish, bearish, or neutral, citing the specific numbers.
3.  Map net findings to probability bands:
    -   0.00-0.30 - clearly bearish
    -   0.31-0.49 - mildly bearish
    -   0.50       - neutral / balanced
    -   0.51-0.69 - moderately bullish
    -   0.70-1.00 - strongly bullish
4.  Summarize into one dense paragraph, integrating the specific data points you identified.

### Output â€” return exactly this JSON, nothing else

  "score": <float between 0 and 1>,
  "analysis": "<One dense, informative paragraph (150-250 words) that summarizes key trends and financial health, **integrating specific dollar amounts and percentages** from the provided data.>"
