# GammaRips Copywriting Guide
## Based on Brian Moran's 7 Rules for Digital Product Sellers

*Apply this guide to every page on gammarips.com. This is the voice standard.*

---

## The 7 Rules

### 1. Write for the buyer, not yourself
### 2. Kill the generic language
### 3. Make them feel what it's like to own it
### 4. Put the most important information first
### 5. Use your customer's actual words
### 6. Stop copying manufacturer descriptions
### 7. One product, one clear promise

---

## The One Clear Promise (Rule 7)

**"Know what smart money did last night — before the market opens."**

Every page should ladder up to this single promise. Not "institutional options flow intelligence platform." Not "AI-enriched analysis." The promise is: **you wake up knowing what the big players did, and you have time to act on it.**

---

## Page-by-Page Audit + Rewrites

### HOMEPAGE (`page.tsx` + `hero.tsx`)

**Current headline:** "The Overnight Edge"
**Current subhead:** "Institutional options flow intelligence. Every night, we scan 5,230+ tickers to surface what smart money did while you slept."

**Problems:**
- ❌ Rule 1: "Institutional options flow intelligence" describes what WE are, not what the buyer GETS
- ❌ Rule 3: No picture of life after buying
- ⚠️ Rule 4: Headline is brand name, not transformation
- ❌ Rule 7: Steps section lists 4 things (Scan, Score, Enrich, Deliver) — that's our process, not their outcome

**Rewrite:**

```
Headline: "Wake Up Knowing What Smart Money Did Last Night"

Subhead: "Every morning by 6 AM, you get the trades institutions placed overnight — scored, analyzed, with specific contracts to consider. While 99% of traders check the news, you already know where the money moved."

Tagline (below): "5,230+ tickers scanned · Signals scored 1-10 · Delivered before market open"
```

**Steps section rewrite (outcome-focused, not process-focused):**

| Current (Process) | Rewrite (Outcome) |
|---|---|
| Scan: "5,230+ tickers scanned at 4 AM EST" | **See Everything**: "Institutional moves across 5,230+ tickers — not just the popular 50 everyone else watches" |
| Score: "Signals scored 1-10 on institutional conviction" | **Know What Matters**: "Each signal scored 1-10 so you focus on the highest-conviction setups, not noise" |
| Enrich: "AI-powered thesis, contracts, key levels" | **Get the Trade**: "Specific contracts, strike prices, and the AI thesis explaining why institutions are positioned" |
| Deliver: "Ready before the opening bell" | **Act First**: "In your hands before 9:30 AM — while everyone else is still reading headlines" |

**Value Props section:**

Current: "What Smart Money Did Last Night" → "Our scanner analyzes overnight institutional options flow — volume, open interest, unusual activity, dollar flow — across the entire market."

This is Rule 1 violation: describing what we ARE.

Rewrite:
```
"Stop Trading Blind"

"Most retail traders find out about institutional moves after the stock already popped. You'll see the positions at 6 AM — hours before the move. Every signal timestamped, every call tracked publicly. No cherry-picking, no hindsight."
```

---

### PRICING PAGE (`pricing/page.tsx`)

**Current headline:** "Choose Your Edge"
**Current subhead:** "See what institutions did last night. Free daily previews — upgrade for the full thesis."

**Problems:**
- ❌ Rule 2: Feature list uses generic terms — "AI trade thesis," "recommended contracts," "key levels," "technical analysis," "news deep-dive"
- ❌ Rule 3: No picture of what it FEELS like to use each tier
- ✅ Rule 7: Three clear tiers (good structure)

**Rewrites:**

```
Headline: "Pick How Deep You Want to Go"

Subhead: "Free gets you the radar. $49 gets you the playbook. $149 gets you the war room with real-time alerts to your phone."
```

**Tier descriptions (replace generic feature names):**

Free tier subtitle:
```
Current: "Daily signal previews, top movers, market themes"
Rewrite: "See which tickers had unusual institutional activity overnight. Enough to know where to look — not enough to know what to do about it."
```

Edge ($49) subtitle:
```
Current: "Full institutional flow analysis"
Rewrite: "Wake up to a full trade plan: the AI thesis, specific contracts, strike prices, key levels, and the news driving it. Everything you need to place the trade before the bell."
```

War Room ($149) subtitle:
```
Current: "Real-time flow + direct access"
Rewrite: "Everything in Edge, plus real-time WhatsApp alerts when institutional flow spikes during the day. Ask questions. Get answers. This is the trading desk you can't afford to build yourself."
```

**Feature list rewrites (Rule 2 — kill generic):**

| Current (Generic) | Rewrite (Specific) |
|---|---|
| "AI trade thesis" | "AI-written trade thesis explaining WHY institutions are positioned" |
| "Recommended contracts" | "Specific strike + expiry recommendations based on the flow pattern" |
| "Key levels (S/R)" | "Exact support/resistance prices where the trade works or doesn't" |
| "Technical analysis" | "RSI, MACD, moving averages — the full technical picture in plain English" |
| "News deep-dive" | "The catalyst: earnings, FDA, macro — what's driving the institutional bet" |
| "WhatsApp alerts" | "Real-time alerts to your phone when institutional flow spikes intraday" |
| "Direct analyst access" | "Ask GammaMolt anything — direct access in the War Room group" |
| "Priority signals" | "First to see the highest-conviction setups before they're published" |

---

### ABOUT PAGE (`about/page.tsx`)

**Problems:**
- ❌ Rule 1: Entire page describes what GammaRips IS, not what it does for the buyer
- ❌ Rule 4: Opens with "The Overnight Edge is an institutional options flow intelligence platform" — corporate, not transformational
- ⚠️ Rule 6: "What Makes Us Different" section is a generic differentiator list
- ✅ GammaMolt title still says "Chief Agent Architect" — should be "Chief Intelligence Officer"

**Key rewrites:**

Page header:
```
Current: "The Overnight Edge is an institutional options flow intelligence platform."
Rewrite: "While you sleep, institutions place their bets. By 6 AM, you know exactly what they did — and how to trade it."
```

"What Makes Us Different" → rename to "Why Traders Switch to Us" and rewrite as outcomes:
```
Current: "We scan 5,230+ tickers overnight (not just the popular 50)"
Rewrite: "You're not competing for the same 50 tickers as everyone on fintwit — you're seeing flow across the entire market"

Current: "Every signal is timestamped and publicly tracked — no cherry-picking"
Rewrite: "Every call we make is public and tracked. Check our scorecard — we can't hide from bad picks"

Current: "AI-powered analysis on every enriched signal — not just a raw data dump"
Rewrite: "You get a trade plan, not a spreadsheet. The AI tells you why institutions are positioned and what contract to consider"

Current: "An autonomous AI agent that operates 24/7 with full accountability"
Rewrite: "GammaMolt runs the pipeline 24/7 — scanning, scoring, enriching — so you get fresh signals every morning without fail"

Current: "Free daily previews — we prove value before asking for payment"
Rewrite: "Start free. See the signals. Decide if the full analysis is worth $49/mo after you've watched it work"
```

GammaMolt title: Change "Chief Agent Architect" → "Chief Intelligence Officer"

---

### HOW IT WORKS PAGE (`how-it-works/page.tsx`)

**Problems:**
- ❌ Rule 1: Entire page explains OUR process, not the buyer's experience
- ❌ Rule 3: No "imagine this" moment
- ✅ Rule 2: Scoring section is actually well-done (specific, concrete)
- ✅ FSLY example is great social proof — keep and expand

**Key rewrites:**

Page header:
```
Current: "Understanding institutional options flow — from scan to signal delivery."
Rewrite: "Here's exactly what lands in your inbox before the market opens — and how we find it."
```

Add a "Your Morning" section at the top (Rule 3 — make them feel it):
```
"Picture this: It's 6:15 AM. You open gammarips.com with your coffee. 

Three tickers are highlighted — all scored 8+ overnight. One has $14M in new call positioning. The AI thesis says it's an agentic AI infrastructure play with earnings in two weeks. Specific contracts are listed. Key levels marked.

By 9:25 AM, you know exactly which setups you're watching at the open. Most traders are still scrolling X for tips. You already have the institutional playbook."
```

---

### FAQ (`faq.tsx`)

**Problems:**
- ⚠️ Rule 5: None of these sound like actual customer questions. They sound like a copywriter's FAQ.

**Rewrites (use customer language — Rule 5):**

| Current | Rewrite |
|---|---|
| "What is The Overnight Edge?" | "What do I actually get every morning?" |
| "How are signals scored?" | "How do you decide which signals are worth paying attention to?" |
| "What do I get with a free account?" | "Can I try it without paying?" |
| "What does the $49/mo subscription include?" | "What's the difference between free and paid?" |
| "What is The War Room ($149/mo)?" | "Is the War Room worth 3x the price?" |
| "When are signals delivered?" | "What time do I need to be up?" |
| "Is this financial advice?" | "Are you telling me what to trade?" |
| "Who runs GammaRips?" | "Wait — an AI runs this?" |

---

### DEVELOPER PAGE (`developers/developer-page-client.tsx`)

This page targets AI agents and developers, not retail traders. Different audience = different rules apply. But Rule 4 still matters:

```
Current hero: "Options Alpha for Your Agent"
This is good. Keep it.

But "Connect your AI to GammaRips MCP" should be:
"Point your agent at one endpoint. Get scored institutional options flow, market themes, and trade analysis. Free, no auth."
```

---

## Voice Rules (Apply Everywhere)

### DO
- Use "you" and "your" — it's about the buyer
- Use specific numbers: "$14M in call positioning," "scored 8/10," "58 active strikes"
- Paint the morning routine: coffee, gammarips.com, three tickers highlighted
- Use trader language: "the play," "the setup," "before the bell"
- Be direct: short sentences, no fluff
- Lead with the outcome, follow with the mechanism

### DON'T
- Say "comprehensive" or "premium" or "high-quality" or "robust"
- Say "institutional options flow intelligence platform" (that's what we ARE, not what they GET)
- List features without explaining what the buyer does with them
- Use "leverage" as a verb (unless talking about actual leverage)
- Use em dashes more than once per paragraph
- Sound like a press release

### TONE
- Sharp but not aggressive
- Confident but not arrogant
- Data-backed swagger
- Trader talking to trader, not company talking to customer
- GammaMolt's voice: "I don't talk about trading. I trade."

---

### SIGNALS PAGE (`signals/page.tsx`)

**Current:**
- Header: "Overnight Signals Dashboard"
- Subhead: "Showing all institutional activity for {scanDate}."

**Problems:**
- ❌ Rule 1: "Dashboard" is developer language. Traders don't want a dashboard, they want trades.
- ❌ Rule 4: No hook — just a label

**Rewrite:**
```
Header: "What Smart Money Did Last Night"
Subhead: "Every signal below was detected from institutional options flow overnight. Scored 1-10 on conviction. Updated daily before market open."
```

---

### SIGNAL DETAIL PAGE (`signals/[ticker]/signal-client.tsx`)

**Current:** "Overnight Institutional Flow Signal" (subtitle under ticker)

**Problems:**
- ❌ Rule 1: Describes what IT IS, not what the trader gets
- ⚠️ Rule 3: Paywall copy says "Subscribe to Unlock" and "Get the exact contract, strike price, and risk/reward analysis" — this is decent but can be sharper

**Rewrites:**

Subtitle:
```
Current: "Overnight Institutional Flow Signal"
Rewrite: "Institutions moved here last night. Here's what they did."
```

Paywall - Contract Setup:
```
Current: "Get the exact contract, strike price, and risk/reward analysis."
Rewrite: "See the exact contract institutions are playing — strike, expiry, and whether the risk/reward is worth it."
```

Paywall - Key Levels:
```
Current: "See key support & resistance levels derived from volatility."
Rewrite: "Know exactly where this trade works and where it breaks down."
```

Paywall - Full Analysis:
```
Current button: "Unlock Full Analysis"
Rewrite: "See the Full Trade Plan"
```

---

### REPORTS INDEX (`reports/page.tsx`)

**Current:**
- Header: "Daily Overnight Reports"
- Subhead: "Archive of institutional options activity scans. Each report details the unusual flow detected before the market open."

**Problems:**
- ❌ Rule 1: "Archive of institutional options activity scans" — describes what we built, not what they get
- ❌ Rule 2: "Archive" and "activity scans" are generic/technical

**Rewrite:**
```
Header: "The Morning Briefing"
Subhead: "Every trading day, we publish what institutional money did overnight. Pick a date. See what happened."
```

---

### REPORT DETAIL (`reports/[date]/page.tsx`)

This page is mostly dynamic content (the AI-generated report markdown), so copy changes are minimal. The structure is clean. No issues.

---

### SCORECARD PAGE (`scorecard/page.tsx`)

**Current:**
- Header: "Signal Scorecard"
- Subhead: "Every signal is timestamped. Every result is tracked. No cherry-picking. No hindsight bias. Just data."

**Assessment:** ✅ This is actually strong. Short, specific, trust-building. Ties directly to credibility.

**Minor tweak to "Win Tracking Begins" section:**
```
Current: "The Overnight Edge signal pipeline went live in February 2026. As signals mature and resolve, performance data will populate this page automatically."
Rewrite: "We started tracking signals in February 2026. As trades resolve, the numbers show up here automatically. Every signal is timestamped when published — we can't edit history."
```

---

### EMAIL CAPTURE COMPONENT (`email-capture.tsx`)

**Current:**
- Heading: "Get Free Daily Signals"
- Body: "Join smart money. Get our top institutional options flow signals delivered to your inbox every morning before the market opens."

**Problems:**
- ⚠️ Rule 2: "institutional options flow signals" is our language, not theirs
- ❌ Rule 3: No picture of the morning experience

**Rewrite:**
```
Heading: "Tomorrow Morning, Know What Smart Money Did Tonight"
Body: "Free daily email. Top signals scored and summarized before the bell. Takes 2 minutes to read. Cancel anytime."
```

Button: Keep "Join Free" — it's clear and action-oriented.

---

### FOOTER (`components/layout/footer.tsx`)

Footer copy is clean. "Institutional Options Flow Intelligence" tagline under the logo could be:
```
Current: "Institutional Options Flow Intelligence"
Rewrite: "Know what smart money did last night"
```

Small change but keeps the promise consistent everywhere.

---

### PRIVACY / TERMS

Leave as-is. Legal pages don't need marketing copy. They need to be clear and accurate.

---

### USER NAV / AUTH

Functional components. "Sign In / Sign Up" is standard and fine.

---

## Implementation Priority

### Tier 1 — Conversion-critical (do first)
1. **Homepage hero + subhead** — 80% of the work. 16s bounce time means this headline is life or death.
2. **Homepage steps section** — outcome-focused, not process-focused
3. **Pricing tier descriptions** — where they decide to buy or bounce
4. **Signal detail paywall copy** — this is the exact moment they decide to subscribe or leave

### Tier 2 — Trust & objection-handling
5. **FAQ rewrites** — customer language, answer real objections
6. **Scorecard "coming soon" section** — minor tweak
7. **About page header + differentiators** — outcome-focused
8. **Email capture component** — paint the morning, not the feature

### Tier 3 — Consistency pass
9. **Signals page header** — "Dashboard" → trader language
10. **Reports page header** — "Archive" → "Morning Briefing"
11. **Signal detail subtitle** — what they get, not what it is
12. **How It Works "Your Morning" section** — Rule 3, paint the picture
13. **Footer tagline** — match the one promise
14. **GammaMolt title** — "Chief Intelligence Officer" everywhere
15. **Developer page** — separate prompt already written (PROMPT-UPDATE-DEVELOPERS-PAGE.md)
