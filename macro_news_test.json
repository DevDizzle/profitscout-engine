      "body": "<p>Artificial intelligence hyperscaler <strong>CoreWeave</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/CRWV#NASDAQ\">CRWV</a>) is trading higher on Tuesday after announcing the launch of CoreWeave Ventures, a fund and support initiative for founders developing platforms and technologies that drive the next phase of <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/pressreleases/25/09/b47564906/coreweave-launches-ventures-group-to-invest-in-future-of-ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">artificial intelligence and computing innovation</a>. The initiative provides capital, computing resources, and technical expertise to accelerate new ideas into real-world applications as demand for AI infrastructure and tools grows across industries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The program offers startups access to CoreWeave's AI-optimized cloud, production-grade testing clusters, and go-to-market guidance shaped by its enterprise network.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Also Read: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-stock-ratings/analyst-color/25/08/47367593/coreweave-growth-fueled-by-openai-contracts-strategic-acquisition-says-analyst\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">CoreWeave Growth Fueled By OpenAI Contracts, Strategic Acquisition, Says Analyst</a></em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Founders can engage through investment, compute-for-equity arrangements, or a technology partner who wants to build a community of participants, including advanced developers and vertical AI application builders. Companies like Moonvalley credit CoreWeave for helping them scale faster and focus on innovation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By combining capital with deep technical alignment, CoreWeave Ventures is a launchpad for entrepreneurs who want to build the AI ecosystem and advance computing's future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>CoreWeave stock plunged 40% in the last three months after failing to reach adjusted EPS consensus estimates in the previous two quarters. The stock tanked 19% after the AI cloud provider posted <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-stock-ratings/reiteration/25/08/47096992/coreweaves-ai-demand-surges-but-expansion-spending-cuts-into-profitability\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">second-quarter revenue</a> of $1.21 billion, up 23.5% sequentially and ahead of estimates, alongside a backlog that swelled to $30.1 billion. Despite the beat, investors reacted to margin pressure and guidance that highlighted heavy near-term costs from ramping capacity toward 900MW by year-end.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stifel's Ruben Roy said CoreWeave beat on revenue and operating income, driven by new contracts with OpenAI and major hyperscalers, but he flagged margin weakness and higher costs. HC Wainwright's Kevin Dede called the quarter \"blockbuster,\" citing strong adoption across consumer and enterprise markets. At the same time, Needham's Mike Cikos pointed to robust backlog growth as a future revenue driver, even as execution and supplier risks loom from aggressive expansion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>CRWV</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Price Action:&nbsp;</strong>CoreWeave shares are trading higher by 7.77% to $100.70 at publication on Tuesday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Read Next:</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong><em><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/sports-betting/25/09/47552517/draftkings-faces-parlay-blow-as-nfl-betting-action-heats-up\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">DraftKings Faces Parlay Blow As NFL Betting Action Heats Up</a></em></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Photo: Shutterstock</em></p>",

These contracts will be cash-settled and aligned to real-time spot market prices (i.e., spot prices of bitcoin and ether, respectively) through daily cash adjustments, using a transparent and replicable funding rate methodology.</p><p>At the HOOD Summit in Las Vegas, Catherine Clay, Global Head of Derivatives at Cboe, remarked: \"Perpetual-style futures have gained strong adoption in offshore markets. Now, Cboe is bringing that same utility to our U.S.-regulated futures exchange and enabling U.S. traders to access these products with confidence in a trusted, transparent and intermediated environment. We expect Continuous futures to appeal to not only institutional market participants and existing CFE customers, but also to a growing segment of retail traders seeking access to crypto derivatives. As we continue to expand CFE's offerings to serve all types of market participants, these futures are a next step to advancing our product innovation roadmap.\"</p><p>The launch builds on Cboe's ongoing commitment to further growing and diversifying its CFE product suite, which in addition to its flagship Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) futures include innovative products based on equity volatility, digital assets and global fixed income.</p><p>The new bitcoin and ether Continuous futures will be cleared through Cboe Clear U.S., a CFTC-regulated derivatives clearing organization, positioning Cboe to further expand its clearing capabilities as it looks to build a robust global derivatives exchange and clearing ecosystem.</p><p>The Options Institute will host educational courses on continuous futures on <a href=\"https://edge.prnewswire.com/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4505397-1&amp;h=2774326688&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fcboe.zoom.us%2Fwebinar%2Fregister%2FWN_buTEgyDPRg2fGy0JePmeEw%23%2Fregistration&amp;a=October+30\">October 30</a> and <a href=\"https://edge.prnewswire.com/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4505397-1&amp;h=2986209957&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fcboe.zoom.us%2Fwebinar%2Fregister%2FWN_5gCrqjRNTgiHKlVwsCnAmg%23%2Fregistration&amp;a=November+20\">November 20</a>.
